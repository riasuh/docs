## New World - Krewella, Yellow Claw ft. Vava
!!! abstract "New World - Krewella, Yellow Claw ft. Vava"
    krewella is my new jam   
    Expert+ 4.65 NPS: has bomb resets, but is more fun   
    Expert 4.69 NPS (nice): has no bomb resets, for less experienced players i guess.    
    both are pretty much identical besides what i just said.   
    thanks emy for giving me tips  
    for rank? i dunno, if alot of people want it ranked, sure. just let me know lol
